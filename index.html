    <h2>Hi! I'm Kenneth, a Full-Stack Web Designer and recent graduate from Codeup, a career accelerator in San Antonio, Texas</h2>
    <p>I took a I have always been interested in the Internet and its construction, even back to my days as a Eagle Scout. I took a different path academically, and worked toward and achieved a degree in Finance from Texas State University. My first job out of College was with Amazon, where I helped launch one of the most successful fulfillment centers in the network.</p>
    <p>This was not something I was finding very inspiring, however, and late in 2017 I decided to make a change. Moving myself to San Antonio, I decided to attend Codeup, and develop my skills as a computer programmer. I have learned both back-end and front-end development, and am skilled in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, MYSQL,  and the spring framework. </p>
    <p>I find a lot of pleasure and fulfillment in web development, whether its developing an app from the ground up, or improving the design and performance of an exciting app, building a real, tangible product is very exciting for me. Though I am more than capable of producing a finished product on my own, I prefer to work in a group environment, as I find that the skills and knowledge of a group always overmatch those of the individual. Front or back end, web development is a space I find a lot of satisfaction and opportunity in.</p>
    <p>This website is an example of my personal Philosophy when it comes to web-design. There are a lot of big and fancy things a developer can do with a website, many of which can add real value to the sites functionality and readability. But over-doing design for designs sake can be detrimental to the sites utility. As a great designer once told me, “a thing is not finished when there is nothing else to add, but when there is nothing else to take away”.</p>
